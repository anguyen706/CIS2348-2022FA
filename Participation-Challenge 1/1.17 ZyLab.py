# 1.17 Input: Mad Lib

# Mad Libs are activities that have a person provide various words,
# which are then used to complete a short story in unexpected (and hopefully funny) ways.

# Complete the program to read four values from input and store the values in
# variables first_name, generic_location, whole_number, and plural_noun.
# The program uses the input values to output a short story.

# Ex: If the input is:
# Eric
# Chipotle
# 12
# cars

# the output is:
# Eric went to Chipotle to buy 12 different types of cars

# Ex: If the input is:
# Brenda
# Philadelphia
# 6
# bells

# the output is:
# Brenda went to Philadelphia to buy 6 different types of bells

# Type your code to read four values here.
first_name = input()
generic_location = input()
whole_number = input()
plural_noun = input()

# Output a short story using the four input values. Do not modify the code below.
print(first_name, 'went to', generic_location, 'to buy', whole_number, 'different types of', plural_noun)
